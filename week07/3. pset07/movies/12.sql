-- You may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Jennifer Lawrence.

SELECT title

JOIN stars s1 ON movies.id = s1.movie_id
JOIN people p1 ON s1.person_id = p1.id
JOIN stars s2 ON movies.id = s2.movie_id
JOIN people p2 ON s2.person_id = p2.id
WHERE p1.name LIKE "Bradley Cooper" AND p2.name LIKE "Jennifer Lawrence";
