Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I predicted that the time would increase (quite logically). I did not expect that 1000000
simulations would take that much more than 100000 ones.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
