/*
For this problem, youâ€™ll implement a program that calculates the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text, per the below.

The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text. The formula is

index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8

where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
