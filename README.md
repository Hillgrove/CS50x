# 🎓 CS50x – My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions and experiments from Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) Introduction to Computer Science course.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Languages

This repository includes a mix of languages used throughout the course:

- 💻 **C** – Core language for the first half of the course
- 🌐 **HTML / CSS** – Used in later weeks for web development
- 🐍 **Python** – Used in final problems and exercises

## 🏁 Final Project: Fallout 2D20 Character Creator

> 🎯 As part of the CS50x final assignment, I created a full-featured character creation tool for the Fallout 2D20 tabletop system.

🔗 **GitHub Repository:**  
👉 [Hillgrove/Fallout2D20-Character-Creator](https://github.com/Hillgrove/Fallout2D20-Character-Creator)

> Built using web technologies, it allows users to generate custom Fallout characters with stats, backgrounds, equipment, and more.
